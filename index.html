                    <p class="textcolor">A navel piercing, also known as belly button piercing, is a piercing through
                        the skin located directly
                        above the belly button. This allows the jewelry to hang slightly over the belly button to
                        essentially
                        highlight itself.</p>

                            better
                            with the natural shape of your body.</li>
